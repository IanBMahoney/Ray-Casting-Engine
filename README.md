# Ray-Casting-Engine

This project was created for a programming class in high school.

It was created within a group of two classmates; myself and Alex Truman.

The prompt was to create a program that pushed our current limits.

We decided to delve into three dementional graphics by creating a basic ray casting engine. 

When running the code, a blank jFrame will apear, once this occurs press ENTER to begin the program.

To move the camera positon use W, A, S and D keys to move forward, backwards, left and right respectively.

Use the Q and E keys to rotate the camera positon left and right.
